## PneuTech - Medical Device Startup 
---
<span style="font-size:1.05em;">**Overview**</span>  
<span style="font-size:0.9em;">
Co-founder and lead of [PneuTech](http://www.pneutechmed.com/){:style="text-decoration: none"}{:target="_blank"}, dedicated to improving the safety and efficacy of lung biopsy procedures. We have developed a novel biopsy needle attachment device, which is patent pending, that enables clinicians to safely sample adequate tissue for cancer diagnosis, research, and personalized treatment.

<span style="font-size:1.05em;">**Background**</span>  
<span style="font-size:0.9em;">
I co-founded PneuTech in Fall 2019 along with a team of 7 biomedical engineering students as part of the [JHU Biomedical Engineering Undergraduate Design Team Program](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/academics/bme-design/undergraduate-design-team/){:style="text-decoration: none"}{:target="_blank"}. We were approached by [Dr. Robert Liddell](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/robert-liddell){:style="text-decoration: none"}{:target="_blank"}, an interventional radiologist from [Johns Hopkins Hospital](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/the_johns_hopkins_hospital/){:style="text-decoration: none"}{:target="_blank"}, who was facing challenges with the current standard of care biopsy needle and procedure. Since completing the Design Team Course in Spring 2020, we spunout to become PneuTech, and have since raised over $45k in non-dilutive funding and are on track for completing animal studies in 2023.
