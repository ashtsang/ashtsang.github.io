**Overview:** Assessing histopathology slides is critical for diagnosing and researching cancer, but is challenging and time consuming for expert pathologists. While integrating deep learning in the field of pathology is promising, there are many challenges in data variability, annotation availability, and generalizability that stand in the way of adoption to the clinic.  
**My Work:** In my project, I am developing deep learning algorithms and a workflow for instance segmentation of immune cells and tissue subtypes in histopathology slides, with only sparse labels available. Specifically, we are collaborating with pathologists from Johns Hopkins Hospital to analyze precursor lesions of ovarian cancer.

**Overview:** Dimensionality reduction is important for interpreting high-dimensional single-cell data. However, validation and interpretation of learned patterns is difficult without ground truth.  
**My Work:** In my project, I am developing an analysis using projectR, a package for transfer learning on single-cell datasets. Specifically, I am working on transferring learned patterns from mice to humans in order to validate learned patterns and derive new insights into breast cancer metastasis.

**Overview:** Non-negative matrix factorization is well suited to high-throughput technology, but can be tricky to infer and interpret.  
**My Work:** In my project, I created PyCoGAPS, a Python implementation of CoGAPS which is a Bayesian NMF algorithm for gene set analysis. PyCoGAPS enahnces runtime for large datasets, and additional workflows I developed with Docker and GenePattern facilitate user-friendly interpretation and implementation of NMF for single-cell analyses.

**Overview:** Computer-assisted robotic surgeries have the potential to improve critical and common procedures, such as cataract surgeries, requiring fine precision and accuracy. A major component to its implementation involves the application of computer vision in order to detect regions of interest.  
**My Work:** In my project, I created a user-friendly script for annotating pupil segmentations across video frames of cataract surgical procedures. Following dataset curation, I implemented traditional computer vision methods and explored deep learning for segmentation of regions of interest.
