Assessing histopathology slides is critical for diagnosing and researching cancer, but is challenging and time consuming for expert pathologists. While integrating deep learning in the field of pathology is promising, there are many challenges in data variability, annotation availability, and generalizability that stand in the way of adoption to the clinic.  
In my research project, I am developing deep learning algorithms and a workflow for instance segmentation of immune cells and tissue subtypes in histopathology slides, with only sparse labels available.

Created PyCoGAPS, a Python implementation of CoGAPS algorithm for gene set analysis.  
Developed user-friendly workflows and usage with Docker and GenePattern, and reduced runtime by 2.8x.
